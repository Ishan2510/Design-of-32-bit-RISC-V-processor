# Design-of-32-bit-RISC-V-processor
Designed a 32‐bit single‐cycle processor adhering to the
RV32I Base Integer Instruction Set using Verilog HDL.
• Utilised Xilinx Vivado to model components such as ALU,
data and instruction memory, control unit, program counter,
and register files.
• Optimized digital design verification process by utilising
Cadence EDA tools (such as NCSim, NCVerilog, etc).
